<h4> About </h4>

I am a philosopher working on the philosophy of science and epistemology. Currently, I am a postdoc at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>, working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nwRZpzEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Effy Vayena</a> and running my independent research project &ldquo;MLS<sup>2</sup>: Machine Learning, Science, and Society&rdquo; that is funded by an <a href="https://grantsoffice.ethz.ch/funding-opportunities/internal/eth-fellowships.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship</a>. I am also an associate member of the <a href="https://www.iris.uni-stuttgart.de/" target="_blank">Interchange Forum for Reflecting on Intelligent Systems (IRIS)</a> at <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/" target="_blank">University of Stuttgart</a>.<br>

Within the research project <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/aiteproject/project" target = "_blank">&ldquo;AITE &ndash; Artificial Intelligence, Trustworthiness and Explainability&rdquo;</a>, I was working on the philosophy of explainable artificial intelligence under the supervision of <a href="https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/ag-spohn/personen/prof-dr-wolfgang-spohn/" target="_blank">Wolfgang Spohn</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=MpJaE0wAAAAJ&hl=de" target="_blank">Eric Raidl</a>.<br>
